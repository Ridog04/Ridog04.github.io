### CPSC 120

* Lab 5

    Lab 5, part 3 was a favorite because I like the game blackjack and always wondered how someone would write code for it. We had to write code that would notice if the cards a player had were over 21. We also had to make sure if an input is not a value in the blackjack game, it was an unknown card.

* Lab 4

    Lab 4, part 2 was a favorite because we had to write code that changed decimal feet to feet in inches. I liked this lab because these types of programs are useful. We had to use equations in order to change decimal feet to feet inches.

* Lab 6

    Lab 6, part 2 was a favorite because we made a guessing game that included the numbers from 1 to 100. I liked this lab because we had to use loops in order to keep checking for the magic number and to check for the wrong numbers. I also liked the hotter and colder aspect of this lab.
